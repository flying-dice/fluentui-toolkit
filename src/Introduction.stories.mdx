## Flying Dice - Fluent UI Toolkit

This Library exposes a bunch of components and functions which compliment [Microsoft's FluentUI
for the Web](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/#/web)

### Helpers API

Within each child section there is a story called API, this contains the API information of any
code which falls outside components, i.e. Helpers, Hooks etc.

### Components

See the Component Stories within each section for further info on Components
